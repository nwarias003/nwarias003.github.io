## Learning TypeScript: A Familiar Yet Challenging Experience

I find that the Typescript programming language in my Software Engineering course interesting, easy to learn and comprehend, especially since it is very similar to JavaScript. Despite the short amount of time I’ve had to learn it, I find Typescript to be more straightforward to follow compared to JavaScript. However, because of my experience in other programming languages, such as, C++ and JavaScript, I sometimes find it challenging since I would tend to confuse the syntax, structure or format of the code, with other coding styles I’ve previously learned. Another concern I have about the language is trying to minimize any confusion when determining how to declare and initialize the numerous explicit variable types. Unfortunately, I tend to get confused on how Typescript declare their variables since I’m already accustomed to how other programming languages declare theirs. 

Even though I still have a lot to learn about Typescript, I do think that it is a good programming language to use, especially with its use of static typing. This aspect of the language helps to increase the readability of the code I'm working on and speeds up the turnaround in catching errors early, consequently reducing the amount of time needed to figure out the cause of the problems. This makes it extremely useful once we start getting into the more larger and complex projects we plan to do within my Software Engineering course. The only downside I see with the programming language Typescript is the learning curve associated with it, especially when transitioning from JavaScript to Typescript since there are a lot more things to take into account when learning it. 



## Embracing the Stress

When I was first introduced to the idea of an “athletic software engineering” strategy where we would be placed under high-intensity and stress-inducing situations to gain competency of the software engineering skills we plan to learn during this semester, it was pretty daunting to hear, especially since I am still trying to learn and understand TypeScript. However, once we started implementing the concepts through the Workout of the Day (WODs), I began to see their benefits. It allows me to simulate the type of pressure I would encounter in my future career as a Video Game Developer. Only through the continual practice of WODs am I able to learn how to deal with the potential stress and pressure from the industry. Additionally, WODs are extremely beneficial since they help me think, analyze, strategize, and concentrate on handling various scenarios, improving my time management and gaining valuable hands-on experience with TypeScript. Overall, I believe the use of WODs will better prepare me for the real world, help me build up my confidence it tacking various issues, improve my competency when managing tasks or projects, and enhance my understanding of the various concepts presented within the class so I may become proficient in using TypeScript.

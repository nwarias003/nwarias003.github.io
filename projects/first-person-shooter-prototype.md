Nexus Onslaught was a Unity First-Person Arcade Shooter video game project that I developed for my CM 343 Game Level Design class at the University of Hawaii at West Oahu in three months. The task involved creating three levels in a level design document for a game using the game engine Unity. Once we completed our design document, we then had to develop a game that implemented at least one of the levels we created in the document. The game I created was a prototype that initially had some bugs in it, since it was my first time programming and developing a game using Unity. Attached above is a video to view of me playing the game at its final phase. However, sadly, I do not have a current version of the prototype available to play, since it was stored on a thumb drive that was accidentally damaged in the washing machine. The only prototype that is available is an old backup version that’s unplayable because it’s missing a lot of the features and mechanics. Still, the video version I have included shows me testing and playing the final prototype before it was damaged without any difficulties.

The main character in the Nexus Onslaught game was named Dakota Wulfric, whose wife has been kidnapped by a corrupt organization called The Akuji. Dakota’s mission in the game is to save his wife before she is used as a test victim and become part of their mutant army. The excitement of the game involves how Dakota avoids near death experiences by shooting his way through hordes of enemies in order to save his beloved one and ultimately the world in the process.

During the development, I was responsible for programming, game and level design, and animation. This included implementing game features and mechanics, putting together the level and light, importing and editing the enemy and weapon models used from the Unity Asset Store, and animating the firing and walking animations for the weapons. If you are interested in seeing the design document I created for the project, you can view it through this link here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SlgTLnV_MWI_e0Zx9rLhd6cR_rqUw7-k9BViJO1R21Y/edit?usp=sharing

After completing the project, I learned how to properly design and create a level that keeps the player interested while also complementing the gameplay. This project afforded me the opportunity to gain practical firsthand game development skills and experience the entire process from beginning to end. It has also reinforced my desire to become a game designer and encouraged me to continue upon my journey of developing games using Unity.

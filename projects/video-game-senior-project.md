The Boss From Hell was a Unity 2D top-down horror video game project that I developed as my Senior Capstone at the University of Hawaii at West Oahu within three months with the assistance of my girlfriend, Ranae Hunter, the animator and character designer. The game was based upon my research into the work environment of the video game industry. The object of the game is for the main character, who’s a video game developer, to collect evidence against his boss who has committed wrongdoings against your colleagues at the game company, while simultaneously trying to avoid being caught by him.
Vacay is implemented using [Meteor](http://meteor.com), a JavaScript application platform. Within two weeks, we created a website that implements several types of reservations including flights, hotels, and car rentals.

During the development, I was responsible for programming, game design, level design, audio design, and maintaining a Tumblr account with progress reports and development (dev) logs. This included implementing game features and mechanics, importing and editing the character animation sprite sheets provided by Ranae, and creating and editing various sound effects and music. Ranae was responsible for designing and animating the characters, and creating numerous items and objects that were not available in the level assets I used from itch.io. I have attached the link here to my Senior Capstone webpage for any interested parties who wish to view the behind-the-scenes development:  https://sites.google.com/hawaii.edu/acmwoseniorcapstones/capstone/fall-2023-seniors/nigel-arias?authuser=0

I have also attached the link here for anyone who wish to play the game.

After completing the project, I learned how to manage my time efficiently. I also learned  that a significant investment of your time is required in order to create a polished game for players to enjoy and experience, especially when working within a tight deadline. In addition, during the game development process, I gained invaluable programming skills while working with Unity. Plus, I painfully experienced firsthand the concept of “game crunch” or working excessive overtime in order to complete the desired task.

## From Halo to Higher Learning: My Gaming Genesis

My first introduction to the world of video games as a kid was from playing Halo: Combat Evolved. Ever since then, I have always been fascinated by the realm of playing video games and the technology involved in developing them.  

Over time my curiosity continued to grow to point where it inspired me to pursue and receive my Bachelor of Arts in Creative Media with a Concentration in Video Game Design and Development from West Oahu. I decided to continue this pursuit even further by matriculating at Manoa in their Second Degree Bachelor of Science program in Computer Science so I could take and learn about more hard core programming courses in order to better prepare myself for developing video games on the programming side. Besides the fact that it’s a requirement to graduate, I was seriously excited to take this Software Engineering class. I was interested in examining how this field plays a major role within the video game industry and see how it could enhance my skills and knowledge regarding game development.  



## Enhancing My Experiences and Skills In Game Development 

As I progress towards my career as a Video Game Developer, is the catalyst behind my interest of learning and better understanding how to properly and efficiently Typescript. Currently, I am proficient in several programming languages, such as, Perl, Java, Javascript, PHP, Python, C, C++, and C#.

I’m looking forward to deepening my expertise in TypeScript by taking this class. Through the lessons provided by this course, I hope to gain invaluable hands-on experience that will allow me to understand the nuances of the language and its practical applications in real-world scenarios. I plan to learn how to properly incorporate these new skills into my future video game development projects. I’m also hoping that by taking this course, it will help me to enhance the development of my communication, problem-solving and time management skills while under stressful scenarios. I believe the more mock stressful scenarios we are exposed to in class, will better prepared me as a career developer, especially when I have to work with others in the future.

Looking Ahead. By continuously learning and adapting to new technologies, I hope to stay at the forefront of the industry so I will be better adapt in any situation I am placed under in the future. My ultimate goals are to contribute to innovative projects that drive technological advancements, and to create engaging and immersive experiences for gamers around the world.

## Learning TypeScript: A Familiar Yet Challenging Experience

I find that the TypeScript programming language has been interesting to learn in my Software Engineering course, especially since it is very similar to JavaScript. Despite the short amount of time I’ve had to learn it, I find TypeScript to be more straightforward to follow compared to Javascript. However, with my experience in other programming languages such as C++ and JavaScript, I sometimes find it challenging because I would tend to confuse the syntax, or the structure or format of the code, with other coding styles I’ve learned. Another thing about the language I'm trying to keep in my head is the declaration and initialization of the numerous variable types explicitly. I keep mixing them up with how the other programming languages I have learned in the past declare their variables. 

Even though I still have a lot to learn about TypeScript, I do think that it is good to use especially with its use of static typing. This asset helps to increase the readability of the code I'm working on and speeds up the turnaround in catching errors early, therefore reducing the amount of time needed to figure out the cause of the problems. This makes it extremely useful once we start getting into the more large and complex projects we will do within my Software Engineering course. The only downside I see with the programming language is that there is a learning curve, especially coming from JavaScript as there are a lot more things to take into account and learn. 


## Embracing the Stress

Ever hear people ragging on engineering companies for delivering late and way over budget? Well, some engineering jobs are really difficult, especially if the requirements and funding are undulating underneath you. Because of the nature of the problem, sometimes engineering firms require large amounts of engineers and workers, inviting further problems and delays.

The Honolulu Rail project at home has become this sort of poster child of failure, budget overrun and overall incompetence in Hawaii. Well, working though regulatory boards and fiscal procedures in Hawaii seems like it's a mind bogglingly difficult job to do. Granted, there might be some fishy stuff going on, but I refuse to believe that everyone is involved for nefarious reasons.

The problem of creating an unprecedented public transportation backbone on an island is difficult! I'm not sure we would have done it right, even if the best people were involved.
